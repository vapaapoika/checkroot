checkroot

DESCTIPTION

This small script, checks if there is enough available disk space on root partition (more than 10M).
If there isn't, it will close and delete NetworkManager's connection, so it won't start again, untill the user restores the backups

WARNING: This script only works with NetowrkManager

GETTING STARTED

The only thing you have to do is to copy the script (checkroot.sh) to /usr/bin (or any other directory wrote in your PATH variable) and add it to startup.
If you want to have a backup of your NetworkManager connections, copy /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections directory to ~/.nm-cons-bac or wherever you want (You need root access to do it):

# cp -r /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections ~/.nm-cons-bac

EDITING THE SCRIPT

If you want to change the least root partition size (default: 10M), you should change the "least" variable.

If you are not using NetworkManager, change the "downcon" function. If you don't know how to do this, discover it or remove the script and search for another one.
